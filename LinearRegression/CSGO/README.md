# **Counter Strike Global Offensive Linear Regression Model**

Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter video game in which two teams play as terrorists and counter-terrorists, 
respectively, and compete to blow up or defend an objective. Teams are five people per side, with players acquiring new weapons and 
items using points earned during the rounds in between rounds of play. Whichever team wins enough rounds, either by killing the entire
enemy team or by successfully planting or defusing the bomb, wins the match.

The data used has been scraped by me and consists of all the competitive matches I have played. If you want to use your own data, 
use an extension called Ban Checker For Steam and then go to your competitive matches history, after that load all your data and save
the webpage somewhere. Use the Script to scrape the data and save it to a CSV file.
